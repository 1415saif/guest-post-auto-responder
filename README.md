What This Workflow Does

This n8n workflow automates the process of managing guest post request emails using AI.

Whenever someone sends you an email, this workflow:

1.  Automatically checks whether the email is a guest post request or not using an AI model .

2.  If the email is a guest post request, it automatically sends a polite and professional reply explaining your pricing and submission process.

3.  If the email is not a guest post request, the workflow stops — so you don’t waste time replying manually.

This helps you save time, stay professional, and automate your communication with potential guest post clients.
